## About The Project

I was discussing betting strategies with a friend at the same time I needed an excuse to learn Dash/Plotly. The result was this little web app.

The Martingale strategy involves the player doubling their bet every loss with the idea that they recover any losses each win. On the surface it is a great strategy however in practice with house odds your expected return is always a loss. Additionally adopters of this strategy expect that it is highly improbable that they lose enough games in a row to bankrupt themselves. This is a fallacy as strings of repeated random outcomes are not uncommon in true random sequences. The chance that a player loses enough games in a row also works in the houses favor because a player will more likely run out of money before the house.
